        Google Calendar is a service for scheduling meetings, events and affairs developed by
        Google. Google Calendar became available in beta on April 13, 2006. The final version was
        presented in July 2009 as a web application and mobile applications for Android and iOS
        platforms. It allows you to set a meeting time, create recurring events, set reminders, and
        invite other participants with an email notification. Event reminders can be received via
        email and Push notifications. Working with the Calendar is carried out in a browser window
        via a web interface, and all data is stored on the Google server, so you can access the
        schedule from any computer connected to the Internet. For convenient work with the Calendar,
        you can use hotkeys and a string to quickly enter an event. For example, "Meet Julia at
        18:00", to add the event "Meet Julia", which starts at 18:00, the function of automatically
        entering letters containing similar lines in the body of the letter into the calendar is
        also available. You can create multiple calendars, as well as automatically mark official
        holidays. One of the key advantages of this service is the ability to share a calendar. It
        can be shown to selected users, which allows you to schedule general meetings. JavaScript
        and AJAX technologies are actively used in the interface, which speeds up the reaction of
        the system and allows you to use it with the same ease as a program installed locally. The
        calendar is available in English, Dutch, Danish, Spanish, Italian, Chinese (Traditional and
        Simplified), Korean, German, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish, Finnish,
        French, Swedish and Japanese. Calendar information can be entered in many other languages.
